### To RUN the entire project you will need to:
# Install node (20.10.0) with nvm (includes npm)
# Install and config postgres@latest
# Intall the angular-CLI@latest globally with npm.
# Install all required dependencies for both backend and frontend.

## All of this will be done through the bash Script.
## Execute the script to run server on localhost port 3000 and frontend on port 4200. It's supposed to run on Linux. To test just navigate to localhost:4200 on your browser.
# RUN ./install.sh to execute the bash script on linux.

## ENV vaiables will not be included on gitignore so the tester can have the exact same config.
## Auth mechanism has been skipped for speed and time.
